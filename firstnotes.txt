My first git notes 

==========================

### III. Remote Repository Connection and Upload Commands

These commands connect the local repository to the remote GitHub repository and push the committed work online:

1.  **Connect Local to Remote:**
  git remote add origin https://github.com/Gokul140989/Desktop_local.git
        *   *Purpose:* This command (which is provided by GitHub upon repository creation) connects the local system to the specified GitHub repository, enabling subsequent movement of files.

2.  **Set Branch Name:**
    *   git branch -M main
        *   *Purpose:* Ensures the local branch is named 'main' (in case it defaults to 'master' on some systems).

3.  **Push Changes to GitHub:**
    *   git push -u origin main
        *   *Purpose:* Uploads the locally committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub
